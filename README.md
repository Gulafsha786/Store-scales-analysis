# Store-scales-analysis-project
A store want to compile a sales report for the year 2023 in order to improve customer understanding and increase sales in 2024.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS:
1. Compare the sales and orders using single chart
2. Which month got highest sales and orders?
3. Who purchased more- men or women in 2022?
4. List top 10 states contributing to the sales?
5. Relation between age and gender based on number of orders
6. Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
7. Highest selling category? Etcâ€¦

All the above questions are answered through this project and an Interactive Dashboard is created.

I used 1.  Data cleaning, 2.  Data Processing,  3.  Data Analysis.
